# High-Throughput-Data-Analysis

This repository contains all the assignments for the Computational Methods for the High-Throughput- Data analysis course. Each assignment is organized into its own folder, which includes the input files, code, and output files, structured within their respective directories.

### Assignment-1
1. Programming Language and Version: Python and Python 3.11.4.

2. Dependencies: Python Libraries. NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn.

3. Input: matrix1.txt, matrix2.txt.

4. Description: This python code generates a 12x12 Pearson correlation matrix from RPKM across various cancers in a specific patient group, using "matrix1.txt" and "matrix2.txt" files using python packages such as Numpy and Pandas. It visualizes the generated matrix as a heatmap to highlight similarities between cancers using various Python Visualization Packages such as Seaborn. Finally, the code computes a Pearson correlation between both the original matrices.

6. Output: Each value of the pearson correlation between two variables of the original matrices are shown in the Heatmaps.
